This project explores the connections between air quality, healthcare spending, and the prevalence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) across U.S. states. We used air quality data obtained from wisevoter.com and the openaq API, along with healthcare spending and COPD prevalence data from the CDC and GHDE. A comprehensive dataset is created, encompassing good, moderate, and unhealthy air quality days, average COPD prevalence, and healthcare spending per capita for each U.S. state. Our project leverages a multiple linear regression model to interpret air quality metrics and predict potential healthcare costs, and our findings revealed that states with better air quality tend to exhibit lower COPD prevalence rates and spend less on healthcare. Specifically, a one-unit increase in the percentage of good air quality days corresponds to a 10.04% reduction in COPD prevalence, while the same increase in moderate and unhealthy days correlates with decreases of 7.9% and 3.30%. In healthcare spending, an increase in the percentage of good, moderate, and unhealthy air quality days corresponds to decreases of $8393.06, $7655.86, and $1924.53.
